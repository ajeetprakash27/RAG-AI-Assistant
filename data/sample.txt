This is a sample document for RAG testing.

Our RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system works by:
1. Loading documents from PDF files
2. Splitting them into smaller chunks
3. Creating embeddings using Google Generative AI
4. Storing embeddings in FAISS vector database
5. Using a retriever to find relevant chunks based on queries
6. Passing retrieved context to Claude for answer generation

The system is designed to answer questions based on the documents provided.
